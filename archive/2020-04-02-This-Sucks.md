At home we have 2 vacuum cleaners:
* a broken one, with a working tube
* a working one, with a broken tube and thus broken nozzles.

Both are useless, but they are useless in different ways.

They have different sized nozzles, so I can't just stick them together.

I decided that it's time to finally stop 3D printing random stuff, and put my 3D designing and printing skills to good use.
