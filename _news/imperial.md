I gave a presentation titled "Lexicase Selection and the Diversity of Quality" to [Dr. Antoine Cully's](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully) [Adaptive and Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) at Imperial College London. Very happy that I got to learn about some of the cool stuff happening there!
