Happy to announce that I was selected as a 2024 [Goldwater Scholar](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/)! I am grateful for the support of my mentors, friends, and family. This year, 438 scholarships were awarded to undergrads in the US, with only 30 going to students in the field of Computer Science.
