<p>I am currently a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst. Recently, I have been working with <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/lspector">Lee Spector</a> on selection strategies in Evolutionary Computation. Additionally, I have been working with <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/">Scott Niekum</a> on improving alignment of reward functions created with Inverse Reinforcement Learning systems.</p>

<p>My research interests include Neuroevolution, Genetic Programming, Artificial Life, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics.</p>
