I am currently an undergraduate at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst. Recently, I have been working with [Lee Spector](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/lspector) on Lexicase selection, a novel selection strategy for evolutionary computation. Additionally, I have been working with [Scott Niekum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/) on improving alignment of reward functions learned from human preferences for Reinforcement Learning from human feedback (RLHF). Furthermore, I am working with [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/) on Quality Diversity Optimization for Reinforcement Learning.

My research interests include Neuroevolution, Genetic Programming, Cognitive Science, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. My goal is to study the emergence of human intelligence from the perspective of evolving and learning autonomous systems. I am planning on applying to PhD programs for the Fall 2025 cycle.
