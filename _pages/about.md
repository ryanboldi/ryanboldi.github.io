I am currently a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst. Recently, I have been working with [Lee Spector](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/lspector) on selection strategies in Evolutionary Computation. Additionally, I have been working with [Scott Niekum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/) on improving alignment of reward functions created with Inverse Reinforcement Learning systems.

My research interests include Neuroevolution, Genetic Programming, Artificial Life, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics.
