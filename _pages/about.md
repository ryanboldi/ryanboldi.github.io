I am currently a Computer Science student at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst. Recently, I have been working with [Professor Lee Spector](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/lspector) on selection strategies in Evolutionary Computation. Additionally, I am a member of the [Bindslings group](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/bindslings/), a subset of the  [Biologically Inspired Neural & Dynamical Systems (BINDS)](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/binds/) laboratory.

My research interests include Neuroevolution, Genetic Programming, Artificial Life, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics.
