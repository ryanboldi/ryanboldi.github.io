Iâ€™m an undergrad at UMass Amherst, researching how intelligence can emerge in adaotive artificial systems that evolve and learn. My focus is on enabling agents to adapt in dynamic, open-ended environments, understanding how intelligence emerges from simple rules, and designing systems that capture the complexity and generality of human intelligence.

With guidance from my mentors, I'm diving into key questions that drive my work:

- With [Lee Spector](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/lspector), I'm exploring selection algorithms for multi-modal and multi-objective optimization in symbolic AI systems using Genetic Programming.
- Working with [Scott Niekum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/), I'm aligning reward functions in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to help robotic and LLM agents better align to the diversity of human preferences.
- Alongside [Stefanos Nikolaidis](https://stefanosnikolaidis.net/) at USC, I leveraged Quality Diversity Optimization to improve adaptability in Reinforcement Learning for 3D robotic control tasks.
- With [Katia Sycara](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/katia-sycara/) at CMU, I investigated collaborative systems where LLM-based agents can work dynamically with human teams.

I am applying to PhD programs for Fall 2025. 
Through approaches like Genetic Programming, Program Synthesis, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Cognitive Science, I hope to build systems that further our understanding of intelligence in autonomous agents and ultimiately in ourselves.
