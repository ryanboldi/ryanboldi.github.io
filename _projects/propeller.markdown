As part of my research on Genetic Programming, I have contributed to the [propeller](https://github.com/lspector/propeller) GP platform. Propeller is a modern Push (propel, get it?) interpreter combined with a GP system that facilitates the evolution of complex computer programs.

My fork of the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ryanboldi/propeller/tree/master/src/propeller).
