Training an AI to play a platformer using Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topologies. \\
This was the first AI project that I've written from the ground up, using my own implenetation of the neuroevolution technique.

NEAT implementation by me: [NEAT](https://github.com/ryanboldi/NEAT) \\
Based on [this](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) paper by K. O. Stanley and R. Miikkulainen.
