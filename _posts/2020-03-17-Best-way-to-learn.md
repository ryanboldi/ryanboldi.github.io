Doing, as alot of the creatures I evolve can show, is a very effective way to learn.
### I decided to put this to the test.

[NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) is my favorite evolutionary algorithm (and probably should be yours too). Before today, I've been using online libraries that someone _else_ wrote like [this one](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic).

Now, I know those work **alot** better and more efficiently, but what kinda learner would I be if I didn't try to code it myself from scratch?
