For the past few weeks, I have been working on some programming projects for school. I'm writing the experiment for my Extended Essay and my math Internal Assessment in python, and my CS Internal Assessment in JavaScript. Consequently, I haven't had much time to work on any personal projects to keep me grounded. 

There is nothing more motivating than completing a project, so I really wanted a short and sweet personal project to work on. I decided that I had enough experience to assign myself a challenge: Program an AI in under 3 hours.

As usual, my first step was to brainstorm. I decided I wanted the game to be as simple as possible, so I searched through my memories for games I played as a child. After deciding on "Red Light, Green Light", I pulled out my trusty drawing tablet and started to tinker with some ideas:

After this, I set a timer and began working. I finished the project in just under 2 hours and a half (including planning time) spread out over 2 days. Here was the final result after a few generations of evolution:
