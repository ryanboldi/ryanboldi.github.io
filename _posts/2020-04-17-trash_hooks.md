One of the main things that made me want a 3D printer was the ability to fix small things around the house. Well, after owning this thing for 3 years, I've finally decided to stop printing statues and tiny mechanical pieces, and take on a "Real" challenge.

So, Let's get into it.

## Problem:
We have a trash can in our kitchen, but we don't use big trash bags as that is more wasteful. Instead, we use our old shopping bags as trash bags. This allows us to not waste shopping bags, and not have to buy more than ONE trash bag.

Here's where the issue comes in: the shopping plastic bags are much smaller than the outer edege of the trash can, so they don't fit well in the trash can without stretching (and potentially ripping). 

## Solution:
My goal is to 3D-print some hooks that hook onto the outer edge of the trash can and and hold out the small trash bags without ripping. 

I got out my calipers and measured the small lip of the can, booted up Fusion 360, and got to designing.

## Final result:
I guess we could say that this was a pretty big success for such a simple project.

## Issues:
They are still a little wobbly and sometimes fall off when replacing the bag. In later versions I will probably make the clip that clops onto the lips of the can slightly tighter.
