To better understand the things I talk about in my other projects, here's a quick introduction to the concept of Genetic algorithms. (My way)

### What is a genetic algorithm?
Simply put, it's a method to optimize a given problem that is based on Charles Darwin's 'Theory of Evolution by [natrual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)'.
#### How do they work?
![Genetic Algorithms Basic structure: Initialization -> Selection -> Crossover -> Mutation -> Termination](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongfang_Liu/publication/260377604/figure/fig2/AS:213452158181378@1427902368463/Genetic-Algorithm-Tree-Basic-steps-of-GA-selection-crossover-and-mutation.png){: .center-block :}
* #### **_Initialization_**  
This is the step where the population is created for the first time, usually all the creatures have completely random genes.  
~~~~  
loop until population is full
    add new randomised creature to population
end for
~~~~

* #### **_Selection_**  


After we test the genes to figure out how good they are (fitness) we select a few of the best performers to be bred into the next generation.
My favorite way to do this is a method called [Roulette wheel selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection).
![Roulette Wheel Selection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Fitness_proportionate_selection_example.png){: .center-block :}  

In fitness proportionate selection, the higher the fitness of a creature in the population, the more likely it is to be selected for the next population.   
~~~~
for all members of population
    sum += fitness of this individual
end for
~~~~    
The above code just totals up the fitnessses.
Next, we need to assign a probability based on the total.
~~~~
for all members of population
    probability = sum of probabilities + (fitness / sum)
    sum of probabilities += probability
end for
~~~~
The above code just figures out the probability for each member of the population. Next, we need to choose the creatures randomly, with a higher probability of selection if their fitness is higher.
~~~~
loop until mating pool is full
    do this twice
        number = Random between 0 and 1
        for all members of population
            if number > probability but less than next probability 
                then you have been selected
                add to mating pool
        end for
    end
end loop
~~~~
After this is completed, we should have a new population that will be our mating pool for the next two steps.

* #### **_Crossover_**   
At this stage, we take the mating pool and breed them together to make a new random population. There are a few good ways to do this:
    * Single-point crossover:  
![Single-point crossover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/OnePointCrossover.svg/231px-OnePointCrossover.svg.png){: .center-block :}  
    * Two-point crossover:  
![Two-point crossover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/TwoPointCrossover.svg/226px-TwoPointCrossover.svg.png){: .center-block :}  
    * Uniform crossover:  
In uniform crossover, each gene is chosen from either parent with equal probability.

General pseudocode for crossover:
~~~~ 
loop until new population is full
    parent 1 = random from mating pool
    parent 2 = random from mating pool
    make child by crossover of parent 1 and 2
    add child to new population
end loop
~~~~

* #### **_Mutation_**
At this stage, we must take the current population and make small random tweaks to their genes. The amount of mutation will be controlled by MUTATION_RATE.
The random mutation of genes can be done in many different ways. In this project, I will simply reassign the gene with a new random value.

~~~~
loop over every member of new population
    loop over every gene in this member
        number = Random between 0 and 1
        if number < MUTATION_RATE
            replace gene with something random
        end if
    end loop
end loop
~~~~


After we mutate the population, we test the fitness of the population again and repeat selection. I'll keep repeating these steps until the goal is met. 
If these steps were followed successfully, we should see some intellegent behaviour emerging!
